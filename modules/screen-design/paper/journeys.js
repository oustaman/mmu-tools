/* Two whole journeys, wireframed: the improved screens of the missed bin case and the bakery case,
   in organisms, with the words from those cases. The decks draw them, and the Screen maker's example
   is the first one, so what is on the slide is what a student gets when they open it.
   A screen: {name, kind, job, pieces: [[organism id, row, {typed words}], ...]}. Words are keyed as in
   organisms.js: the starting words, and which time they occur in that organism. */
