1. **Title:** Session 8 - Heuristic Evaluation Lab - Week 8 of 11
2. **Recap:** You have sketches + flow diagram, now evaluate!
3. **What is Heuristic Evaluation?** Systematic review using Nielsen's 10 principles, Expert evaluation method, Find problems before users do
4. **Why Do This?** One of your testing artefact options, Shows critical thinking, Industry-standard method, Demonstrates professional UX practice
5. **The Method:** Review against each heuristic (1-10), Rate severity (0-4 scale), Document specific issues, Suggest improvements
6. **Severity Ratings:** 0 = Not a problem, 1 = Cosmetic, 2 = Minor usability, 3 = Major usability, 4 = Catastrophic (must fix)
7. **Example Evaluation:** Show banking app, Review against Principle 3 (User Control), Find issue: "No way to cancel transaction mid-process", Rate severity: 3 (Major)
8. **Activity: Evaluate Sample App (15 min):** Everyone evaluates same app (MMU library app suggested), Use heuristics checklist, Document 5 issues with severity ratings
9. **Compare Findings:** What did everyone find? Which issues are most common? Agreement on severity?
10. **Now: Evaluate YOUR Design:** Review your own sketches, Be honest - find real issues, This shows critical thinking ability
11. **Activity: Self-Evaluation (20 min):** Students review sketches against all 10 heuristics, Document findings with severity, Note which principles you applied well
12. **Document Your Findings:** Create findings summary table, Can be one of your artefacts!, Include: Heuristic violated, Description, Severity, Recommendation
13. **Share Discoveries:** What surprised you in your own design? What changes would you make? Did you find issues you hadn't noticed?
14. **Iteration Based on Findings:** Note changes you'd make if you had more time, This goes in Section 2: Iteration & Refinement, Shows professional self-reflection
15. **This Goes in Slide Deck:** Section 2 - Testing Methods slide, Mention heuristic evaluation, Include key findings, Show iteration decisions
16. **What You've Learned:** Heuristic evaluation method, How to systematically find usability issues, Critical evaluation skills, Professional testing approach

6. **Example Problem Analysis:** Library booking app - "Students struggled to find available study rooms quickly. App required 7 clicks through menus. User review: 'By the time I found a room, it was taken.' 73% abandon rate on booking flow. Lost study time impacts academic performance."
7. **Activity: Write Problem Analysis (20 min):** Students draft their 200-250 word problem analysis, Must include: Problems, Evidence, Impact, Use the format from brief
8. **Solution Evaluation Content:** How design addresses each problem, Specific features that solve pain points, Expected improvements in UX, How you'd measure success
9. **Before/After Comparison:** Show clear contrast, "Before: 7 clicks, 73% abandon" vs "After: 2 clicks, availability shown immediately", Quantify improvements where possible
10. **Example Solution Evaluation:** "My design solves the availability problem by showing all free rooms on the home screen with color-coding (green=available now). Users can filter by time/capacity without navigating menus. Success metric: Reduce booking time from 3 minutes to 30 seconds."
11. **Activity: Write Solution Evaluation (20 min):** Students draft 200-250 word solution evaluation, Explain HOW design solves problems, Include expected outcomes
12. **Evidence-Based Claims:** Don't just say "it's better", Explain WHY it's better, Reference your UCD principles, Use testing insights (heuristic evaluation)
13. **Recommendations Content:** Next steps for development, Additional testing needed, Future features to add, Implementation considerations, Scalability thoughts
