# UXCI Assessment Brief 2024/2025 - REVISED
## Individual Digital Product Evaluation Report

---

## Assessment Brief

You need to improve the customer experience for a **small to medium-scale service or organization**.

**Scale Guidelines:**
- ❌ **Do NOT choose:** Large multinational corporations (e.g., Amazon, Google, Netflix, major banks)
- ✅ **DO choose:** Services that are manageable in scope and easy to research, such as:
  - Community services (libraries, local councils, community centers, sports clubs)
  - Small businesses (independent cafes, local gyms, bookshops, restaurants)
  - Non-profit organizations or charities
  - University services (student union, campus facilities, study spaces)
  - Local government services (waste collection, parking, permits)
  - Independent healthcare providers (dental practices, physio clinics, opticians)
  - Niche online services or apps with focused functionality

**Why this scale?**
The service should be small enough that you can:
- Understand the full user journey
- Identify specific, actionable problems
- Propose realistic improvements
- Research without needing extensive corporate access

## Assessment Deliverables

All of the following are required:

1. **A Prototype** (hand-drawn sketches + flow diagram)
2. **Artefacts** (2 items from specified categories)
3. **A Slide Deck Report** (10-20 slides, structured format)

---

## 1. PROTOTYPE REQUIREMENTS

Your prototype must consist of **TWO components**:

### Component A: Hand-Drawn Screen Sketches
- Create hand-drawn sketches of **6-10 key screens** for a mobile app
- Sketches should show the main user interface elements, navigation, and content
- Can be drawn on paper, whiteboard, or tablet (but hand-drawn, not using software)
- Submit as clear photos or scans in your slide deck
- Must demonstrate **two key user-centered design principles** (e.g., accessibility, usability, visibility of system status, error prevention, user control, consistency, etc.)

### Component B: User Flow Diagram (MANDATORY)
- Create a **visual flow diagram** showing how users move through your app
- Must include:
  - Entry points
  - Decision points (user choices)
  - All major user paths/journeys
  - Error states or alternative paths
  - Exit points/task completion
- Use standard flowchart symbols (rectangles for screens, diamonds for decisions, arrows for flow)
- Can be hand-drawn OR created digitally (Google Slides, Draw.io, Miro, etc.)
- This flow diagram is a **core assessment component** that demonstrates your understanding of information architecture

### Optional (Not Assessed):
- You may create a clickable version using Google Slides or similar tool to demonstrate your concept, but this is **not required and will not be graded**

**How this addresses Learning Outcomes:**
- **LO1**: Sketches and flow demonstrate application of user-centered design principles
- **LO3**: Flow diagram shows interface and information architecture analysis

---

## 2. ARTEFACTS REQUIREMENTS

Provide **TWO UX design artefacts** from any of the following categories:

### Category 1: User Research Artefacts
- Personas (with demographics, goals, pain points, context)
- User journey maps (showing touchpoints, emotions, pain points)
- Empathy maps
- User interviews summary or key findings
- Competitor analysis matrix

### Category 2: Design Artefacts
- Annotated wireframes (additional to prototype sketches, showing design rationale)
- Design specifications (typography, color rationale, accessibility considerations)
- Content hierarchy diagrams
- Navigation structure diagrams
- Mood boards or visual design explorations

### Category 3: Testing & Evaluation Artefacts
- Usability test plan (methods, tasks, success criteria)
- Test scripts with scenario descriptions
- Heuristic evaluation report (systematic review against Nielsen's heuristics or similar)
- User testing findings summary (observations, issues identified, severity ratings)
- A/B testing proposal or results

**Note:** Iteration notes alone do not count as an artefact. The flow diagram required in Component B does not count as one of your two artefacts.

**How this addresses Learning Outcomes:**
- **LO1**: Artefacts demonstrate user-centered design process
- **LO2**: Testing artefacts show critical evaluation capability
- **LO3**: Testing artefacts apply usability methods
- **LO4**: All artefacts demonstrate application of UX principles

## 3. SLIDE DECK REPORT

**Format:** Minimum 10 slides, maximum 20 slides, up to 2000 words total

### Important Notes:
1. No penalty for fewer words, provided all sections are comprehensively covered
2. These **three slides are required and do not count** toward your slide limit:
   - Title slide (your name and student ID)
   - Prototype link/location slide
   - Closing slide
3. Add slide numbers to all slides
4. Optional slides may only appear in Section 4 or Section 5
5. Use the structured format below with **approximate word counts per section**

---

## Why This Format Works for LLM-Assisted Feedback

This revised assessment structure is optimized for initial feedback from local LLMs (Gemma 12b, Deepseek 8b, etc.) because:

1. **Structured text format:** Each section has clear word counts and content requirements
2. **Explicit sections:** LLMs can check if each required section is present and complete
3. **Objective criteria:** Flow diagrams have clear components that can be evaluated (entry/exit points, decision nodes, etc.)
4. **Reduced visual subjectivity:** Hand-drawn sketches remove pressure for visual polish; focus is on UX thinking
5. **Checkable elements:** LLMs can verify presence of two principles, two artefacts, required sections, etc.
6. **Clear mapping to rubric:** Each section directly maps to learning outcomes and rubric criteria

Students can receive quick initial feedback on:
- Completeness of sections
- Clarity of explanations
- Logical flow and structure
- Evidence of UX thinking
- Appropriate use of terminology
- Gaps in their analysis

This allows you to focus human grading time on nuanced evaluation of quality, creativity, and critical thinking depth.
