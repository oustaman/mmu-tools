        description: "D群RK is a new dynamic research community driven by meaningful research connections and a passion for creative excellence. The D群RK is research-led, practice-based, interdisciplinary and public-facing. Through art and creative practices, the primary research focus for D群RK is to investigate occulture, the paranormal, magic, esoterism and counterculture. We are passionate about using insights from occulture to create innovative research outputs which are impactful beyond academia through pioneering new and alternative cultural and social understandings of the world. We aim to achieve this through reusing and remediating physical and metaphysical technologies to invent new and peripheral forms of storytelling, developing innovative methodologies, and to explore the practices and discourses of subcultural and countercultural movements to refigure hegemonic epistemologies and develop new ways of thinking.",

        description: "Drugs, Drug Policy and Social Change (DPSC) addresses novel and emerging challenges in research design, knowledge translation and policy impact within the regional, national and international Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) research. DPSC studies AOD from within the social sciences. This includes the study of drug trends, patterns and cultures across the market incorporating use, supply, cultivation, and production. Our vision seeks to better understand the meaning of drugs within contexts, cultures and communities and connect this knowledge to societal responses to drugs, including approaches to policy, practice and media discourse. Our research draws on a broad interdisciplinary theoretical framework which includes criminology, sociology, economics, social psychology, and cultural studies. We adopt a collective approach to research, specializing in ethnography, participatory methods, creative methods and narrative approaches. DPSC strives to promote positive social change within affected communities and impact the work of policymakers, treatment and support providers, advocacy and activist groups and drug policy organization and networks.",
